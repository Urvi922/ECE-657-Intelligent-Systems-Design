# ECE-657-Intelligent-Systems-Design
Project from ECE 657 Intelligent Systems Design

This course helped aquire knowledge on fundamentals of soft computing based design approach using such tools as approximate reasoning, fuzzy inferencing, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and neuro-fuzzy systems. It also helped gain experience on it's real world applications in virtually most fields of engineering.
